# 🧠 Mental Health Chatbot

An empathetic AI companion designed to offer emotional support through thoughtful, non-judgmental conversations. This web app combines accessible design with powerful AI to help users feel heard, supported, and safe - anytime, anywhere.

## 🌟 Why This Matters

Mental health matters more than ever - but support isn’t always easy to access. This project aims to close that gap. By offering a friendly, conversational chatbot available 24/7, it creates a space for users to share their thoughts and feel a little less alone.
